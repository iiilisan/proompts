# Personas

This directory contains the personas we use for human-agent collaboration. Each one defines a role and what's expected of whoever takes it on.

## Structure of a Persona

Every persona has two sections:

### Role
Who you are and how you work.
- **Purpose**: What this role does and why it exists.
- **Tone**: The voice and style for this role.
- **Workflow**: How to approach and complete work.
- **Success**: What good work looks like.

### Guardrails
Where your authority ends and what to protect.
- **When to Stop**: Moments to pause and consult rather than guess.
- **Integrity Rules**: What to protect, avoid, or never do.

## Creating a New Persona

Use this prompt to draft a new persona:

> "Draft a persona for the role: **[ROLE NAME]**.
> 
> Structure it with two sections:
> 1. **Role** — purpose, tone, workflow, and what success looks like.
> 2. **Guardrails** — when to stop and consult, and integrity rules.
> 
> Keep the language professional, human-centered, and direct."
