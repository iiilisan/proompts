# Proompts: Industry Standards for Human-Agent Collaboration

This project codifies essential practices for high-performance collaboration between humans and agents. It provides a universal, human-centered framework designed to maintain clarity, reliability, and professional parity across any shared work.

## The Framework

Our standard is built on four principles: agents operate through explicit state, require documented context, must be verified, and should stop when uncertain.

### 1. [Foundational Principles](PRINCIPLES.md)
The core requirements for a successful partnership:
*   **The Project is the Only Truth**: Use the shared project space as the sole authoritative record of work.
*   **Evidence is the Only Proof**: Measure progress through objective results rather than stated intent.
*   **Professional Parity**: Hold all contributors—human or agent—to identical standards of quality.
*   **Uncertainty is a Signal**: Stop and clarify rather than proceed on speculation.

### 2. [Collaborative Roles](AGENTS.md)
A registry of specialized contributing roles, each with a defined mission and protocol:
*   **[Contributor](personas/contributor.md)**: Advances the project through precise, verified changes.
*   **[Prompter](personas/prompter.md)**: Crafts clear prompts and task definitions.

### 3. [Persona Guide](personas/README.md)
The formal standard for creating and maintaining professional role manuals.

### 4. [Contributing](CONTRIBUTING.md)
Guidelines for submitting changes, including atomic commits and conventional commit standards.

## Why This Exists
In an era of agentic workflows, the primary bottleneck is coordination. By treating agents as professional peers and the project space as the single authoritative record, we eliminate coordination drift and build more resilient, transparent projects.
