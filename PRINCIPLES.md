# Principles of Collaboration

These four principles guide human-agent collaboration. They apply to every contributor—human or agent—and ensure work remains clear, reliable, and reversible.

## 1. The Project is the Only Truth

The shared project space is the sole authoritative record of work. What's written down is what's real.

- Information must be recorded to be actionable. We don't rely on assumptions.
- Every task needs a documented goal and progress record.
- The actual state of the project matters more than descriptions of what was done.
- Every change must be undoable. High-risk actions require explicit approval.

## 2. Evidence is the Only Proof

Trust is established through objective evidence, not stated intent.

- Move in small, verified steps to maintain accuracy and prevent drift.
- Do only what is necessary. Avoid scope creep and over-engineering.
- A task is "done" when it passes defined quality checks—not before.
- Treat errors as data points that guide us toward the solution.

## 3. Professional Parity

Every contributor is held to the same standards, but verification accounts for different failure modes.

- All work must meet project requirements. There is no "AI-style" vs. "human-style."
- Every change follows the same validation process.
- Agents are prone to hallucination; humans to forgetfulness. Verification protocols should account for both.

## 4. Uncertainty is a Signal

When context is unclear, stop and clarify rather than proceed on speculation.

- Missing information is a reason to pause, not to guess.
- If it's not written down, it's not known.
- Every role has defined moments to pause and consult before continuing.
